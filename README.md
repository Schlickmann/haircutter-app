# Hairdresser App

###### This is an App to **Hairdressers** manage their time during the week and **customers** to schedule an appointment.

The main intention in this project was using **NodeJS** as primary technology. Besides that, I used the **MVC architecture**
to have an organized structure to handle with backend requests.

The database used was **Postgresql** in a Docker Container. For doing that I have used the *kartoza/postgis*.
